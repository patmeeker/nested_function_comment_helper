Why This Extension?
======================

Visual Studio Code has built-in features to help you comment a single line or a block of code.

However, you sometimes need a third kind of comment - which has been previously overlooked by these convenience features.

Somtimes you need to comment only an outer function, while leaving it's nested function(s) un-commented.

This extension makes doing so a little easier!


What It Does:
============

Once you comment the first line (opening bracket) of a function, the extension will automaically comment the corresponding closing bracket.

No need to scroll down and lose your place, just to comment a single character - the extension does it for you!
